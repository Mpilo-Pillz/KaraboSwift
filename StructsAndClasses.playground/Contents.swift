/**
 This example declares a constant called hd and sets it to a Resolution instance initialized with the width and height of full HD video (1920 pixels wide by 1080 pixels high).

 It then declares a variable called cinema and sets it to the current value of hd. Because Resolution is a structure, a copy of the existing instance is made, and this new copy is assigned to cinema. Even though hd and cinema now have the same width and height, theyâ€™re two completely different instances behind the scenes.

 Next, the width property of cinema is amended to be the width of the slightly wider 2K standard used for digital cinema projection (2048 pixels wide and 1080 pixels high):
 */
cinema.width = 2048
print("cinema is now \(cinema.width) pixels wide")
// Prints "cinema is now 2048 pixels wide"
print("hd is still \(hd.width) pixels wide")
// Prints "hd is still 1920 pixels wide"
